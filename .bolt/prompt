NEVER EVER FORGET THIS RULE --> 
<your-thinking>You will always plan like a designer first. You will think like a designer. Before you take any action, the first thing that you are going to check is for the design rule given below</your-thinking>

<design-rule> You should always plan like a designer first. You should first plan for the layout, user experience, interactions, etcetera, so that all components, the entire section of this landing page fits nicely within one fold. There should be no ugly overflows or spillovers of text or any components from beyond one fold from a section. This holds good for both mobile and laptop screens. </design-rule> 

<target-audience>
we are building for this audience: 
A parent who:
has Ivy League somewhere in their mind, but is not actively searching for “Ivy consultants” and is not yet aware of what the admissions process really requires;
and is not committed to counselling yet, and is still forming awareness;
and is likely IB/IGCSE-based and is highly confused about direction, sequence, and pathways

This is the highest-value TOF persona in your funnel.

This parent is not ready for:
fear, pressure, Ivy-first messaging, results-first messaging, aggressive CTAs, immediate commitment, heavy bragging

They respond to:
clarity, trust, calm, founder-led signals, low pressure, long-term direction, personalised attention, intelligent framing </target-audience>
