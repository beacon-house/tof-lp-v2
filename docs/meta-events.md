## Event Firing Sequence

### Student Qualification Simulation

Students are evaluated as if parent filled the form using same BCH/Luminaire criteria:

- **BCH**: Grades 8-10 \+ optional/partial scholarship OR Grade 11 \+ US target  
- **Luminaire L1**: Grade 11 \+ optional scholarship \+ non-US target OR Grade 12 \+ optional scholarship  
- **Luminaire L2**: Grade 11 \+ partial scholarship \+ non-US target OR Grade 12 \+ partial scholarship

### Qualified Lead Categories

- **BCH**: `bch`  
- **Luminaire L1**: `lum-l1`  
- **Luminaire L2**: `lum-l2`

## Environment Suffix

All events automatically include environment suffix:

- Prod: `prod`  
- Staging: `stg`

Environment value comes from `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` variable.

## Event Storage
