## Event Firing Sequence

### Page 1 Completion Flow

1. **Primary Classification Events** fire first based on form filler type and spam detection
2. **General Funnel Event**: `mof_v1_page_1_continue_{env}`
3. **Category-Specific Events**: Based on determined lead category
4. **Qualified Parent/Student Events**: If applicable

### Page 2 Flow

1. **Page 2 View**: General \+ category-specific \+ qualified events
2. **Page 2 Submit**: General \+ category-specific \+ qualified events
3. **Form Complete**: General \+ category-specific \+ qualified events

## Qualification Logic

### Spam Detection

- GPA \= "10" OR percentage \= "100"

### Student Qualification Simulation

Students are evaluated as if parent filled the form using same BCH/Luminaire criteria:

- **BCH**: Grades 8-10 \+ optional/partial scholarship OR Grade 11 \+ US target  
- **Luminaire L1**: Grade 11 \+ optional scholarship \+ non-US target OR Grade 12 \+ optional scholarship  
- **Luminaire L2**: Grade 11 \+ partial scholarship \+ non-US target OR Grade 12 \+ partial scholarship

### Qualified Lead Categories

- **BCH**: `bch`  
- **Luminaire L1**: `lum-l1`  
- **Luminaire L2**: `lum-l2`

## Environment Suffix

All events automatically include environment suffix:

- Prod: `prod`  
- Staging: `stg`

Environment value comes from `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` variable.

## Event Storage

- Events are tracked in form state via `triggeredEvents` array
- Events are included in webhook payload for database storage
- Events are sent to both Meta Pixel and Google Analytics

## CTA Event Tracking Architecture

### Dual-Layer Event System

When ANY CTA button is clicked, **TWO events fire**:
1. **Common Event**: `mof_v1_cta_click_{env}` (tracks ALL CTA interactions)
2. **Specific Event**: Button-specific event (tracks which button was clicked)

### CTA Event Combinations

#### "Book a Founder Strategy Call" Button (TrustSection)
Fires 2 events:
- `mof_v1_cta_click_{env}` (common)
- `mof_v1_book_call_{env}` (specific)

#### "Request an Evaluation" Button (TrustSection)
Fires 2 events:
- `mof_v1_cta_click_{env}` (common)
- `mof_v1_request_evaluation_{env}` (specific)

#### Sticky CTA Button (Mobile/Desktop - Bottom)
Fires 2 events:
- `mof_v1_cta_click_{env}` (common)
- `mof_v1_sticky_cta_click_{env}` (specific)

### Implementation Details

**Location**: `src/lib/metaEvents.ts`

```typescript
// Fires 2 events for TrustSection buttons
export function trackMofCtaClick(ctaType: 'book_call' | 'request_evaluation'): string[] {
  const events: string[] = []
  events.push(trackMetaEvent('mof_v1_cta_click')) // Common
  if (ctaType === 'book_call') {
    events.push(trackMetaEvent('mof_v1_book_call')) // Specific
  } else if (ctaType === 'request_evaluation') {
    events.push(trackMetaEvent('mof_v1_request_evaluation')) // Specific
  }
  return events
}

// Fires 2 events for Sticky CTA
export function trackMofStickyCtaClick(): string[] {
  const events: string[] = []
  events.push(trackMetaEvent('mof_v1_cta_click')) // Common
  events.push(trackMetaEvent('mof_v1_sticky_cta_click')) // Specific
  return events
}
```

### Benefits of Dual-Layer System

1. **Aggregate Tracking**: `mof_v1_cta_click_{env}` provides total CTA engagement across all buttons
2. **Granular Analysis**: Specific events show which CTAs perform best
3. **Flexible Reporting**: Can analyze both individual and combined performance
